I am a highly motivated fourth year undergraduate at UNC Chapel Hill, double majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) and Statistics & Analytics (B.S.), currently applying to graduate programs in computer science with a focus on security and privacy research. I have strong interests in applied cryptography, blockchain technology, distributed and descentrialized systems, postquantum cryptography, and the relationship between AI technology and secure systems. 

For the spring of 2025, I will be working on a research project with Dr. Saba Eskandarian, focusing on privacy perserving systems.
